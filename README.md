Installation
------------

The recommended way to install Email is through [Composer][1]:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "black/email": "@stable"
    }
}
```

__Protip:__ You should browse the [`black/email`][2] page to choose a stable version to use, avoid the `@stable` meta
constraint.

Usage
-----

Usage is simple. Just create a new EmailEmail, if your email is invalid an `Email\Exception\InvalidEmailEmailException`
will be thrown. Be aware of this, the validation is on the format, not on a A or MX record in a valid DNS.

```php
$email = new Email\EmailEmail("foo@bar.com");
$email->getValue(); // return foot@bar.com
$email->getValueAsArray() // return ['recipient' => "foo", 'domain' => "bar", 'tld' => "com"]
```

__List of available getters__

- `getValue()`
- `getValueAsArray()`
- `getRecipient()`
- `getDomain()`
- `getTld()`

__Check if two email are equals__

`isEqualTo(Email\EmailEmail $email)`: Check if two emails are equals
